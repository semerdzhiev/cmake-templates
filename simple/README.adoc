This repository contains a simple template for new CMake projects.

For more information on the individual features, see the sections below.

== .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file contains the following definitions:

* Several commonly used directories. Currently `.vs/`, `out/` and `build/`.
* {url-cmake-presets}[`CMakeUserPresets.json`] local presets file.

== Directory Layout

There is a single `CMakeLists.txt` file located in the root of the project.

`src/`::
Sources for building the project.
`test/`::
Tests related to the project.

== External Libraries

The template uses {url-cmake-fetch-content}[`FetchContent`] to automatically retrieve {url-catch2}[Catch2].
