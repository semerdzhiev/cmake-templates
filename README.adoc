= Sample Templates for CMake Projects
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
:toc:

== Description

This repository contains several sample templates for CMake projects.

minimal/::
A minimalistic template with a very simple `CMakeLists.txt` file. Just the bare minimum to get you started on a simple project.

simple/::
A basic template with support for unit testing with the Catch2 framework. Catch2 is automatically retrieved from its GitHub  repository using `FetchContent`.

standard/::
A template with support for several commonly used libraries and project documentation generation. External libraries are retrieved as git submodules.

For a detailed description of what is included in each template and instructions on how to use them, please refer to the README files in the respective directories.


== How to use the templates

1. To base your work on one of the templates, simply copy it somewhere, edit the existing files as necessary and add your own stuff.

2. If you plan to use Git, initialize the repository:
+
[source,bash]
git init
+
Probably you will also want to add a remote and set up tracking branches, for example:
+
[source,bash]
git remote set-url origin <your-remote>
git push -u origin main
+
Note that each template comes with its own `.gitignore` file. take a look at what's inside and edit it, as you see fit.

3. If the template uses submodules, after initializing the repository, run the necessary command to initialize submodules and retrieve their contents:
+
[source,bash]
git submodule init
git submodule update

4. Refer to each template's README file for specific build instructions, information on what is included, etc.


== Building a project

To build your CMake project and run the tests, first go to your project's directory. Inside it create a directory for an out-of-source build (e.g. `build/`). Go inside it and then generate the build files there. Finally, build the project and run the tests.

For example, if your project is located in `C:\projects\my project`, then the list of commands may look like what is shown below. If you are not using unit tests, skip the `ctest` line.

[source,bash]
cd "C:\projects\my project"
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest

Every time you alter `CMakeLists.txt`, you will need to refresh the build files. You can do it either by going to the `build/` directory and running:

[source,bash]
cmake ..

or by specifying the directories explicitly, in which case you can run the command from another directory too:

[source,bash]
cmake -S "C:\projects\my project" -O "C:\projects\my project\build"

To rebuild, you need to run CMake and pass the `--build` parameter. Again, you can do it by going in the `build/` directory and running:

[source,bash]
cmake --build .

Or by specifying the directory explicitly:

[source,bash]
cmake --build "C:\projects\my project"


== Speeding up the builds

The `CMakeLists.txt` files, in all projects, contain the necessary directive, which passes the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/mp-build-with-multiple-processes?view=msvc-170[`/MP` switch] to Visual C++, so that jobs are ran in parallel. This may (or may not) significantly speed up build times.

Another option is to use CMake's https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#build-tool-mode[`--parallel`/`-j` switch]:

[source,bash]
cmake --build . --parallel

If you want to specify the number of jobs, you can do so:

[source,bash]
cmake --build . --parallel 8

The topic is complicated and as of the time of writing of this tutorial, there is no one definitive answer on how to approach it. Check out https://stackoverflow.com/a/70102570[this reply on Stackoverflow] for more details and additional references.

== Visual Studio Code Setup

You may want to install the following Visual Studio Code extensions. Each extensions is listed with its ID and name.

When searching for the extensions, we recommend that you look them up by their ID. That's because there may be multiple extensions with the same name.
